# Friends-Trivia

### Overview

This trivia game shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out. If the player selects the correct answer, a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option will appear. After a few seconds,  the next question will be displayed without any user input. The scenario is similar for wrong answers. If the player runs out of time, the correct answer will be displayed and the game will proceed to the next question. However, if the player runs out of time, the game will proceed to the next question without displaying the correct answer. On the final screen, the player will see the number correct, incorrect, and unanswered responses as well as an option to restart the game.
